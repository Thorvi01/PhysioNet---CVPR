# Sections:
#   - Paths: where data lives and where checkpoints get saved
#   - Fold: which split of data to use for validation
#   - Image layout: the geometry of a rectified ECG image
#   - ECG physics: how pixel positions map to millivolts
#   - Model: which backbone and decoder to use
#   - Training: learning rate, batch size, epochs, etc.
